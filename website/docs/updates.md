# Update & Release Process

VibeStack Codex uses GitHub Releases for distributing updates automatically.

## How Updates Work
- The app checks for updates on startup and every 2 hours.
- If a new version is available, it is downloaded and the user is prompted to restart.
- Updates are delivered via the GitHub Releases page: [iotserver24/codex/releases](https://github.com/iotserver24/codex/releases)

## How to Get Updates
1. Open VibeStack Codex.
2. If an update is available, you will see a prompt to restart and apply the update.

## How We Release Updates
