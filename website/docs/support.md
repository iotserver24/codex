# Support VibeStack Codex 💝

VibeStack Codex is a **completely free** AI development platform, and we're committed to keeping it that way! However, building and maintaining cutting-edge AI tools requires significant resources, and your support makes all the difference.

## 🌟 **Why Your Support Matters**

### 💰 **The Cost Reality**
Running a world-class AI platform involves:

- **🤖 AI Model Integration**: Research, development, and testing of 25+ AI models
- **🖥️ Infrastructure**: Servers for updates, documentation, and community support  
- **👨‍💻 Development**: Full-time developers working on features and bug fixes
- **🔒 Security**: Regular security audits and compliance measures
- **📚 Documentation**: Creating tutorials, guides, and examples
- **🤝 Community**: Discord servers, forums, and user support
